The setupCommitMessageHook.sh script will setup git commit message hook.

By running this script in your project root directory will create commit-msg hook inside your .git/hooks directory.

This hook will enforce the user to format the commit message. Commit message should be in "<Committer name> #123 Commit message" format and the message should not excite more than 200 characters.
